            <h2>About RA 10630</h2>
            <p>Republic Act 10630- Is an act that strengthens the juvenile justice system in the Philippines by amending Republic Act 9344, also known as the "Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006". The amendment includes the establishment of **Bahay Pag-asa**, a 24-hour child-caring institution that provides short-term residential care for children in conflict with the law who are above 15 but below 18 years of age ยน.
