            <h3>Explore the Features</h3>
            <p>Juvenile delinquency refers to the involvement of minors in activities or behaviors that are considered criminal or antisocial. The features of juvenile delinquency encompass various aspects related to the causes, characteristics, and consequences of such behavior. </p>
            <h3>Here are some key features:</h3>
            <h4>Age Group</h4>
            <p>Definition: Juvenile delinquency specifically involves individuals who are below the age of 18 (the age of majority in many jurisdictions).</p>
            <p>significance:The legal system recognizes that juveniles may not have the same level of culpability as adults, and rehabilitation is often emphasized over punitive measures.</p>
            <h4>Types of Offenses</h4>
            <p>Minor Offenses:Juveniles may be involved in less serious offenses, such as truancy, curfew violations, or shoplifting.</p>
            <p>Serious Crimes:In some cases, juveniles may commit more serious crimes, including vandalism, assault, or theft.</p>
            <h4>Risk Factors:</h4>
            <p>Family Environment: Broken families, abuse, neglect, and lack of parental guidance can contribute to delinquent behavior.</p>
            <p>Socioeconomic Factors: Poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and community violence are risk factors.</p>
            <h4>Psychological and Behavioral Aspects:</h4>
            <p>Mental Health Issues:Juveniles with mental health disorders may be at a higher risk of delinquency.</p>
            <p>Behavioral Disorders:Conduct disorders or oppositional defiant disorders can contribute to delinquent behavior.</p>
            <h4>Peer Influence:</h4>
            <p>Peer Pressure: Influence from delinquent peers can lead to the adoption of antisocial behaviors.</p>
            <p>Gang Involvement:Joining gangs can expose juveniles to criminal activities and violence.</p>
            <h4>Legal Responses:</h4>
            <p>Juvenile Courts:Specialized courts handling cases involving juvenile offenders.</p>
            <p>Diversion Programs:Alternatives to traditional court proceedings, focusing on rehabilitation.</p>
            <h4>Intervention and Rehabilitations:</h4>
            <p>Counseling and Therapy: Addressing underlying issues and providing emotional support.</p>
            <p>Educational Programs:Focusing on skill development, education, and vocational training.</p>
            <p>Community Service:Involvement in community service as a form of restitution.</p>
            <h4>Prevention Program:</h4>
            <p>Community Outreach:Programs aimed at preventing delinquency through community involvement and support.</p>
            <p>Mentorship: Providing positive role models and mentors for at-risk youth.</p>
            <h4>Consequences and Legal Records:</h4>
            <p>Educational Impact:Delinquency can lead to expulsion from schools, impacting educational attainment.</p>
            <p>Legal Records: Juvenile records may have implications for future employment and educational opportunities.</p>
            <h4>Restorative Justice:</h4>
            <p>Focus on Rehabilitation:The emphasis is on rehabilitating the juvenile offender rather than solely punishing.</p>
            <p>Repairing Harm:Restorative justice approaches involve the offender taking responsibility for their actions and making amends to the victim and the community</p>
            <p>Understanding these features is crucial for developing effective strategies for prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation to address juvenile delinquency and promote positive youth development. It often requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving families, communities, schools, and the legal system.</p>
